These are a handful of projects completed either for university or in preparation for interviews.

Galaxy Classification

This was my final project for my degree with the Open University. It documents the process of developing neural networks to classify galaxy images and explores the ethical ramifications of this technology.

Tree Species Recognition

This was the final piece of work for my Machine Learning module. It investigates some of the challenges faced by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) when attempting to classify tree species from images.

Electronic Sales Data

This project was completed as part of an interview process. It demonstrates an investigation I carried out within a limited timeframe using fictional sales data.
